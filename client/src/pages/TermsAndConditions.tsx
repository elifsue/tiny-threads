            Welcome to TinyThreads. These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TinyThreads platform, including our website and any related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            TinyThreads is a peer-to-peer marketplace for buying and selling second-hand children's clothing and accessories. We act as an intermediary platform and are not a party to the transactions between buyers and sellers.

          <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3">2. Definitions</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            "Buyer" means any user who purchases items through the Service. "Seller" means any user who lists items for sale. "Item" refers to any children's clothing, shoes, or accessories listed on the platform. "Buyer Protection" refers to our programme that safeguards purchases as described in our Buyer Protection policy.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            You must be at least 18 years old to create an account.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            When you purchase an item, you enter into a contract directly with the seller. All purchases are covered by our Buyer Protection programme. You have 2 days after delivery to inspect the item and raise a dispute if it does not match the listing description.
          </p>

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            Sellers must ensure that all listed items are accurately described, including condition, size, brand, and any defects. Items must be children's clothing, shoes, or accessories only. Sellers are responsible for shipping items within 5 working days of a sale.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            A Buyer Protection fee of 5% (minimum &pound;0.50) is added to each purchase. This covers secure payment processing, dispute resolution, and our refund guarantee. Full details are available on our Buyer Protection page.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
            Payments are processed securely through our platform. Sellers receive the full item price — the Buyer Protection fee is paid by the buyer. Seller earnings are held in their TinyThreads Wallet and can be withdrawn to a linked bank account or PayPal.
